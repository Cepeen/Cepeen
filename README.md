Node HS Admin
<br><br>
An application designed for remotely managing local instances of interfaces for AI models, such as Stable Diffusion Web UI (for creating and editing images), Text Generation Web UI (to use, for example, Llama 2), and TTS Generation WebUI (for manipulating audio material). It consists of a backend written using Node.js and a simple frontend utilizing Express and EJS. The application allows not only the management of AI interfaces but also the creation and execution of personalized console scripts, making it a simple web application for managing, for instance, a home computer. Access is secured with a password that can only be set from localhost. Running local instances of algorithms makes sense if sufficient computational power is available.
